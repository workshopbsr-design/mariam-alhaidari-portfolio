### Architectural Closure
This release marks the formal closure of the project’s foundational architecture.
All core structural, deployment, privacy, and narrative decisions are now intentionally fixed, forming a stable baseline upon which future iterations may evolve without reinterpreting first principles.
Subsequent changes beyond this point shall be treated as extensions, not revisions, and must preserve the architectural intent established herein.
Architecture is now complete. Evolution may proceed.
