🏗️ System Architecture README

> Primary Architectural Reference — Single Source of Truth

This document defines the architectural principles, decisions, transitional strategies, and long-term vision for this system. All implementation must comply with this document unless an explicit ADR (Architectural Decision Record) states otherwise.




---

🎯 Architectural North Star

We are not building pages. We are building a system that must live, evolve, and scale.

This architecture prioritizes:

Longevity over speed

Explicit decisions over implicit hacks

Modular growth over monolithic convenience

Architectural governance over ad-hoc fixes



---

🧠 Core Architectural Principles

1. Zero-Intelligence Router

> The Router must contain no logic, no data, no conditions, no props.



Router responsibilities:

Route declaration only

Component wiring only


❌ Router must NOT:

Fetch data

Pass props

Contain business logic

Make architectural decisions



---

2. Self-Contained Pages

Every page must be self-contained.

A page:

Owns its data access

Owns its state

Owns its side-effects


❌ A page must NOT:

Receive business data via props from Router

Depend on parent for core data



---

3. Explicit Transitional Architecture

Temporary solutions are allowed only if:

They are documented

They are tracked as Technical Debt

They have a Sunset Clause

They align with long-term architecture


❌ Silent hacks are forbidden ❌ Implicit debt is forbidden


---

4. Feature-Based Architecture (Target)

Long-term structure is Feature Modules, not Pages.

We do NOT scale by files. We scale by bounded contexts and features.


---

🧩 Current Transitional State

Projects Page

Status: Transitional / Architecturally Acknowledged Debt

Current issues:

God Component (700+ lines)

Mixed layers (UI + Data + Business Logic)

Embedded features (comments, gallery, assets)


This is intentional and documented during transition.


---

ADR-001 — Transitional useProjects Hook

Status

ACCEPTED


---

Context

Projects page is a God Component

It previously received data via Router props

This violated Self-Contained principle



---

Decision

Introduce a transitional useProjects hook to:

Make Projects page self-contained

Clean Router

Preserve business continuity


This hook is NOT final architecture.


---

Rationale

Why this approach:

Enables immediate Router compliance

Avoids blocking other work

Creates architectural breathing room

Preserves architectural narrative


Rejected alternatives:

Full rewrite now ❌

Keeping props ❌

Silent temporary fix ❌



---

Consequences

Positive:

Router becomes Zero-Intelligence

Page becomes Self-Contained

Architectural governance preserved


Negative (Managed):

God Component remains temporarily

Transitional hook added

Requires scheduled refactor



---

Sunset Clause

This transitional hook must be removed by Q3 2024 and replaced with:

Feature-based modules

Clean data layer

Proper domain separation



---

Architectural Debt Register

PRJ-001 — Projects Page God Component

Component: Projects.tsx

Type: Architectural

Severity: High

Introduced: Transitional Phase

Target Resolution: Q3 2024


Technical Description:

700+ lines

UI + Business Logic + Data Access mixed

Embedded Comments, Gallery, Assets

Firebase access at component level


Business Impact if Unresolved:

High maintenance cost

Difficult parallel development

High onboarding time

Increased bug surface



---

Target Architecture — Feature Modules

src/features/projects/
├── list/           # Project listing & filtering
├── detail/         # Project detail modal
├── comments/       # Comments system
├── gallery/        # Image gallery
├── assets/         # 3D models, blueprints, media

    ├── hooks/      # Real domain hooks
    ├── services/   # Data access layer
    ├── context/    # Feature state
    └── types/      # Domain types

Benefits:

Parallel team development

Clear ownership

Scalable complexity

Testable features

Reduced cognitive load



---

Migration Strategy

We follow Strangler Pattern:

1. Build new features alongside old


2. Gradually extract responsibilities


3. Run systems in parallel


4. Cut over when stable



No big-bang rewrites.


---

Governance Rules

What is allowed:

Transitional hooks (documented)

Temporary architecture (with sunset)

Explicit debt


What is forbidden:

Silent hacks

Router logic

Props as data layer

Undocumented architectural changes



---

Team Operating Model

We operate as System Architects, not task solvers.

We prioritize:

Architectural clarity

Long-term maintainability

Decision documentation

System longevity



---

Execution Policy

Once an ADR is:

Accepted

Documented


➡️ It is executed.

No architectural second-guessing without new ADR.


---

Current Approved Transitional Actions

✅ Create useProjects.ts (Transitional)

✅ Remove props from Projects.tsx

✅ Keep God Component temporarily

✅ Track debt explicitly



---

Architectural Timeline

Q2 2024 (Now)

Transitional hooks

Router cleanup

Debt documentation


Q3 2024

Feature extraction

Data layer creation

Modularization


Q4 2024

Optimization

Documentation

Architecture review



---

Final Statement

> We are not optimizing for this sprint. We are optimizing for the next 3 years.



Architecture is a leadership decision.

This document is binding architectural governance.


---

Any deviation requires a new ADR.
